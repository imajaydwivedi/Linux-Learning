Managing Passwords
------------------

-> Users can change their password using "passwd"

-> Administrators can manage passwords and their properties using "passwd" and "chage"
    -> Use "chage -l" to list password properties
    -> Use "chage" for prompts about all changeable settings
    -> Use different options with "passwd -S" and "chage" to change password properties

-> To change passwords without interactive prompt:
    -> On Redhat, "echo password | passwd --stdin username"
    -> On Ubuntu, "echo username:password | chpasswd"

-> Password settings are written to /etc/shadow

-> Ubuntu has PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) for password management sitting in background to regular pasword policies.
    -> Example, password complexity, password expiration etc
