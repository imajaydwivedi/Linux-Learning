Understanding Advanced Linux Permissions
----------------------------------------

-> Set User ID (SUID) (4)
    -> On files: runs the file as the user-owner of that file

-> Set Group ID (SGID) (2)
    -> On files: runs the file as the group-owner of that file
    -> On directories: sets ownership on newly created items as the group owner of that directory

-> Sticky Bit (1)
    -> On directories: allows a user to delete files if
        a) the user is file owner
        b) the user is directory owner

-> To find files with SUID
    sudo find / -type f -perm /4000 -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null

ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
    # -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 64152 May 30  2024 /usr/bin/passwd

ls -l /etc/shadow
    # -rw-r----- 1 root shadow 2106 Jan  2 21:32 /etc/shadow

# Test SUID scenario
    # make copy of /etc/hosts
    sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts_bkp

    # create a script to delete a critical file which only root can delete
    sudo vim /home/student/playme.sh
    |------------$ sudo cat /home/student/playme.sh
        #!/bin/bash

        echo do you want to play
        read

        rm /etc/hosts_bkp --no-preserve-root

    # give execute permission to the script
    sudo chmod +x /home/student/playme.sh

    # test script execution as "student"
    sudo su - student
    ls -l
        # -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 81 Jan  4 11:26 playme.sh
    # try executing. "rm" code in script should fail as it needs root permission
    ./playme.sh
    exit

    # set SUID on the script
    sudo chmod u+s /home/student/playme.sh

    # test script execution as "student" again
    sudo -i -u student
    ls -l
        # -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 81 Jan  4 11:26 playme.sh
    # try executing. "rm" code in script should now succeed as SUID has been set
        # NOTE: Bash Shell does not allow SUID scripts to run. So, we need to use "sh" to run the script
    ./playme.sh


# Get differential permissions
    sudo ls -l /home/student/playme.sh
        # -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 79 Jan  4 11:58 /home/student/playme.sh

    # take snapshot of SUID files
    sudo find /home -maxdepth 2 -type f -perm /4000 > /tmp/suid_snap1.txt

    # remove SUID
    sudo chmod u-s /home/student/playme.sh
    sudo ls -l /home/student/playme.sh
        # -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 79 Jan  4 11:58 /home/student/playme.sh

    # take snapshot of SUID files
    sudo find /home -maxdepth 2 -type f -perm /4000 > /tmp/suid_snap2.txt

    # track changes
    diff /tmp/suid_snap1.txt /tmp/suid_snap2.txt

        |------------$ diff /tmp/suid_snap1.txt /tmp/suid_snap2.txt
        1d0
        < /home/student/playme.sh

    # above result says line 1 from snap1 is missing in snap2

Symbols in diff Output

    a: Added lines.
    d: Deleted lines.
    c: Changed lines.
    <: Content from the first file.
    >: Content from the second file.

A typical output -
-------------------
    2,4c2,4
    < Line from File1
    < Another line from File1
    ---
    > Line from File2
    > Another line from File2

Explanation:
-------------
    2,4c2,4: Lines 2-4 in File1 are changed to lines 2-4 in File2.
    <: Lines from File1.
    >: Lines from File2.
    ---: Separator showing difference location.
